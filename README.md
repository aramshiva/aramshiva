### Hi there! I'm Aram Shiva

I'm a student from Seattle who has a passion for computer science and software development. 

- I help out with community operations at [<img src="https://assets.hackclub.com/icon-rounded.svg" width="14" height="14" /> Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), where I help with conduct, community events and occasional engineering help.
- I help organize [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aramshiva/aramshiva/refs/heads/main/codeday.svg?raw=true" width="14" height="14" /> CodeDay Seattle](https://hackclub.com/), where I help plan coding events for underserved areas across the Metro Seattle area.

- I used to organize [Hack The Sound](https://hackclub.com/), which was a hackathon which was the first of it's kind hackathon outside of the metro Seattle area.
